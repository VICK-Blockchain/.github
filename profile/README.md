#  VICK Project Page
This project aimed to address long-standing challenges in managing HPV vaccination records and informed consent by developing the Vaccine Informed Consent Knowledge base (VICK). By combining semantic web technologies with blockchain, we created a system that not only standardizes data but also ensures it's secure, shareable, and easier to work with across different healthcare systems. One of the biggest problems with current immunization tracking is that systems often do not have means to communicate with each other. Each state may have its own rules, formats, and databases, making it hard to get a complete picture of a patient’s vaccination history. VICK helps solve this by using standardized terms and relationships (from existing biomedical ontologies) to make data understandable and usable across platforms. This ensures that even if two clinics use different systems or languages, they’re still able to share and interpret the same information correctly.
